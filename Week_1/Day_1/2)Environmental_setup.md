# Environment Setup

To begin with the workshop, we first need to set up the working environment.  


### Steps:

1. **Create a new folder named `VSD`**  
   This folder will act as the workspace for the entire workshop.  
   ```bash
   mkdir VSD


2. **Open the terminal inside the `VSD` folder**
   Navigate into the folder to ensure all files are stored in the right place.

   ```bash
   cd VSD
   ```

3. **Clone the workshop repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
   ```


### About the Cloned Repository
